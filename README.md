# PCB-Design

This project includes all the related schematics, CAD files, notes, etc. to be used when designing my first PCB.
This is also my first use of GitHub, so there will be a lot of mess and mistakes in here, please bear with me for anyone viewing this in the future!

For reference, I have no experience with electrical engineering, and will primarily be basing my journey on the blog posts from Masterzen and the PCB Designer Guide from ai03
